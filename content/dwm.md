dwm (the dynamic window manager) is the backbones of DFI and its graphical environment.

## Using

DFI has built-in documentation for dwm, which can be obtain by pressing `super + F1` or by clicking the small ‚ùì in the top right corner.

That should be your guide for upping your dwm power-level, but here are some generalities:

- dwm automatically tiles windows by the pattern of your choosing, and most active windows are given visual preference. You can turn off tiling if you need, or float individual windows.
- Everything is a keybinding, including all the main programs used in DFI. The goal is to minimize the distance between mind and matter, so that computing becomes reflexive: you can think up an email to send, and have it sent in 10 seconds.
